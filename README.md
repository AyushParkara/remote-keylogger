Tthis is a code for educational purpose all accessers are requested not to use it for any unethical purposes.
this is a remote keylogger which alows the user to access the keylogs of a particular device
It allows the server device to send the keylogger.py file to the client of whom we need to get the key logs.
In this project the keylogs are provided upto date no email process or file is used.
Also every changes and keylogs are reflected after every press of enter key.
In client or say keylogger.py the server device needs to enter the server device's IP address to get the keylogs and connection estabilished.
